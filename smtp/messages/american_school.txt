We are pleased to announce the release of the Badkan, the new product that will revolutionize your daily corrector.

Badkan is a website that brings together students and instructors in computer science and automatically corrects exercises prepared in advance by an instructor. Thus, any instructor using Badkan will gain correction time. Students receive immediate feedback (including a note) after submitting their responses. All in one platform with many other options that make it easy for instructors and students.

We are waiting for your return to possibly make an appointment.

Thank you in advance,
Cordially.
